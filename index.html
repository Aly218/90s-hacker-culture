            <h1>&lt;h1&gt;Kevin Mitnick and the Criminalization of Curiosity&lt;/h1&gt;</h1>
            <div class="topic">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In the early 1990s, hackers and hacking used to be seen as experimentation and fostered a culture of curiosity. The term "hacker” originally referred to clever programmers and engineers. In fact, hacking was the reason many systems were developed so quickly, such as ARPANET, early phone systems, and the early decentralized Internet. Without curiosity and a genuine want for an accessible Internet, many of these technologies would have taken much longer to be developed. As discussed in class, “Hackers: Threat or Menace?” (1994), WIRED introduces the “hacker ethic”, a shared belief that information should be publicly available to everyone and that systems should be understood, and technology can be used creatively.</p>
                <p>As computers became commercialized, hacking became criminalized by the government and the corporations who wanted to make money. Corporations saw hackers as a threat to their profits, and the government saw them as a threat to national security. The Secret History of Hacking (2001), viewed in class, demonstrates how media coverage and popular movies quickly turned the public against hackers and portrayed them as villains.</p>
                <p>As can be expected, the media took advantage of Kevin Mitnick's rise to popularity. With all the buzz around Kevin Mitnick, the media further criminalized the word “hacker” and continued to foster a community of fear around hackers. Kevin Mitnick was a prominent figure in the 1990s, hacking into more than 40 major corporations and gaining access to their systems. This caused him to later find himself on the FBI’s most wanted list.</p>

                <h2>Early Hacking</h2>
                <p>Hacking became criminalized in the United States after the passing of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986. “The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) was enacted in 1986, as an amendment to the first federal computer fraud law, to address hacking” (NACDL). The first federal computer fraud law was the Comprehensive Crime Control Act passed in 1984, which mainly protected against hacking the government. Moreover, “The CFAA prohibits intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization, but fails to define what “without authorization” means. With harsh penalty schemes and malleable provisions, it has become a tool ripe for abuse and use against nearly every aspect of computer activity” (NACDL).</p>
                <p>The CFFA specifically made it illegal to explore systems, curiosity was no longer permitted. With the introduction of the CFFA, arrests and prosecutions of hackers have become more common. In some cases, such as Kevin Mitnick, these prosecutions seemed to be more like persecution. Kevin Mitnick was fascinated by phone systems and social engineering, but he treated it more like a challenge. He didn’t seek any monetary reward and didn’t intend to cause anyone harm. However, since he did engage in computer trespassing, he was pursued and eventually jailed for 4 years.</p>
                <p class="red">An extreme sentence for a curious computer enthusiast.</p>

                <h2>Arrest and Media Reaction</h2>
                <p>Kevin Mitnick was finally arrested in 1995 after 2 years on the run. According to an article by Los Angeles Times, the Department of Justice partook in a two-week electronic manhunt to find Mitnick. The tone of this particular article, “Fugitive North Hills Hacker Arrested in N. Carolina : Crime: Kevin Mitnick eluded authorities for two years. He is alleged to have cost victims millions”, was very negative. The media painted Kevin Mitnick as a bad guy and the authorities as the good guys. The article even called Kevin an “electronic terrorist”.</p>
                <p>The article presents Kevin as a horrible guy that needs to be brought to justice before he causes more harm. A supervisor from the San Deigo Supercomputer Center commented that many people depict hackers in a positive light in search of information but what he needs is to be punished for his crimes. The article also mentions what federal authorities were told about Kevin, “Please be aware that if Mitnick is taken into custody, he possesses an amazing ability to disrupt one’s personal life through his computer knowledge,” said an advisory from the U. S. Marshal’s Service issued to law enforcement recently” (Johnson et al., 1995). This warning seems a bit extreme in retrospect, making it seem like he was this criminal who was going to emotionally manipulate the authorities. Overall, the article fueled the fear that Americans were feeling regarding Hackers and continued to criminalize them.</p>
                <p>In another Los Angles Times article, “‘Condor’ Myth Loop of Contradictions : Computers: To some, Kevin Mitnick is an electronic terrorist. Others say he’s a prankster.”, the writer discussed two perspectives on the whole situation. Ann W. O’Neill noted that while some saw Kevin Mitnick as an electronic terrorist, others thought he was a harmless prankster. One of his friends even pointed out that “The fact that Mitnick hasn’t been known to profit personally, one hacker friend said, is ‘a testament to his moral character.’” (O’Neill, 1995). His friends also insist that Mitnick is a relatively harmless prankster who enjoys testing the extent of his abilities and that the allegations against him are a bit extreme. One Deputy U.S. Marshal, Kathy Cunningham, said that Mitnick spent all his time on computer keyboards to show off, not for any personal monetary gain.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, the charges against Mitnick may have been a bit extreme but in the end the chain of prosecutions against Mitnick and other hackers was a show of whose boss, the government and corporations. In a way, a precedent needed to be established that this behavior was not okay. A third article, Feb. 15, 1995: Mitnick Arrested (WIRED), suggests that “The case bestowed upon Mitnick a sort of antihero status while raising the consciousness of hacking and computer security in the general population” (Long, 2012). This is a new take on the situation that can be seen in movies such as Hackers, The Net, and Antitrust where the hackers are the good guys fighting against evil corporations and the government.</p>

                <h2>Trial and Impact</h2>
                <p>There is a lot of controversy around claimed damages that Mitnick caused to various companies including Motorola, Nokia, Sun Microsystems, and Novel. A paper written by Scott Moss, through the GIAC certification program at the SANS Institute, discusses this issue in his work titled “Kevin Mitnick: Criminal or Conspiracy Victim?”. Kevin served four years for illegally copying proprietary software belonging to major companies and costing them millions. However, “Kevin and his numerous supporters claim he has been set up to be an example of the harsh punishment hackers would receive. The majority of the populace at the time believe the sentence to be fair, but Kevin and his loyal supporters believe the case was a conspiracy” (Moss, 2001, 2).</p>
                <p>The government claimed that Kevin caused major companies around $80 million dollars. Apparently, these claims were based on the costs of research and development for the software that Mitnick illegally downloaded. However, Mitnick argues that these claims are not true and that the government's goal is to make an example out of him, basically an attempt to scare away any future hackers.</p>
                <p>The media and government succeeded in making an example out of Kevin Mitnick, “The majority of the populace at the time believe the sentence to be fair, but Kevin and his loyal supporters believe the case was a conspiracy” (Moss, 2001, 2). Although most people thought Kevin’s sentence was fair, his supporters protested on his behalf in what became known as the “Free Kevin” movement. Overall, like what we saw in the Y2K incident, the media tends to try to instill fear in the public, what better way to get more “clicks”. However, as we have seen, there is always more than one side to a story. As a result, we get extravagant movies who defend the little guy, in this case, hackers fighting against the government and corporations.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there are those hackers who seek to cause harm, especially today when we hear about a cyber-attack incident on the news more often than we can count. There are bad people out there seeking to cause corporations and individual harm through various methods like social engineering, like Kevin used. Also, through the use of more technical attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service attacks, viruses, or even zero-day attacks. Although it was unfair for the government and the media to make an example out of Kevin, computer laws are needed. Especially today as technology continues to advance in the wake of AI.</p>

                <h2>Life After and Legacy</h2>
                <p>Life after prison, Kevin had an arc of redemption and rebranded himself as a security consultant. Today, he is a trusted security consultant to various Fortune 500 companies and even to the government. He even has his own company, “As the CEO of Mitnick Security Consulting, Kevin, and The Global Ghost Team™ now maintain a 100 percent successful track record in their ability to penetrate the security of any system they’re paid to hack, using a combination of technical exploits and social engineering” (Davies, 2021). Kevin found a way to turn his curiosity into a well-respected job where he continues to exploit systems and have fun, in a legal way.</p>
                <p>He also has a role at KnowBe4 as the Chief Hacking officer where he helps companies train employees to manage the various security risks we continue to face today. He has played a major role in shaping the definition of ethical hacking. It gives genuine computer enthusiasts an outlet to do what they love most in a way that helps others.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Overall, Mitnick’s case changed how society treats digital exploration. As we saw in class, other laws, like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), exist. This law was created to prohibit circumventing technological measures that control access to copyrighted work. With the development of the Internet and advancement of technology, new laws like the CFAA were necessary. A good parallel is remixing. In the beginning, remixing was a form of creative expression, but people began to argue that their intellectual property was being stolen. As seen today, it is cheaper to do a parody of a song than to use clips from a song. Similarly, before the Kevin Mitnick case, digital exploration was normalized. After the case, it was made clear to the public and hackers that the behavior exhibited by Kevin was not acceptable.</p>
                <p>This is most likely a trend that we will continue to see. Whenever something new happens, it is met with wonder and excitement. Later, people begin to consider the negative impacts of the new shiny thing, like AI. At first it was seen as a wonder and now people are worried about the adverse effects it can have on jobs, privacy, and even on the environment.</p>
                <p>In the end, Mitnick’s story shows how quickly society moved from celebrating digital curiosity to fearing and punishing it. His case represents a turning point in how exploration, learning, and experimentation were no longer seen as harmless but instead treated as dangerous. Instead of eliminating curiosity, society chose to control it by placing boundaries around it. This pushed hacking into legal spaces, like penetration testing, rather than allowing it to exist freely.</p>
